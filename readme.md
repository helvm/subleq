This project contains a working Forth interpreter that runs on top
of a SUBLEQ 16-bit machine. SUBLEQ machines belong to the class of One
Instruction Set Computers, they only execute a single instruction but are
still Turing Complete. The Forth system, specifically a variant of eForth,
is provided as [subleq.dec](subleq.dec), passing this image to the tiny (~
700 bytes) [SUBLEQ C virtual machine](subleq.c) allows you to run eForth
on the machine. For a list of commands type "words" and hit enter, numbers
are entered using Reverse Polish Notation, eg. "2 2 + . cr" prints "4",
and new functions can be defined like so:

	: hello cr ." Hello, World" ;

Be careful with the spaces, they matter, after typing that in, type "hello"
and hit enter. A Forth tutorial will not be provided here. Many Forth words
are defined *including the bitwise words*.

To build and run you will need a C compiler and Make, type "make run",
failing that:

	cc subleq.c -o subleq
	./subleq subleq.dec

[subleq.dec](subleq.dec) is generated from [subleq.fth](subleq.fth), which
requires [gforth](https://gforth.org/) to compile. Unless you want to change
the eForth interpreter just stick with the pre-generated image.

Happy hacking, and a shiny penny for anyone that manages to do something
useful with this project!
